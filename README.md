# wumpus
This is a repository with the famous wumpus world solved with gama platform and multiagent system.

To test the code, you must download gama platform 
(the java-based multi-agent systems application) 
if possible version 1.9.3 (you can download it 
at this link https://gama-platform.org/download)

Once downloaded you can test it by downloading the 
models folder and copying the contents 
of the wumpus2.gaml file into a new gama project.
